# KoalaSendGrid
This is still an alpha release. Feel free to use it but please report any problems.

You need a config file which includes the following:
- sendgrid_api_key
- sendgrid_default_subject
- sendgrid_from_address
- sendgrid_from_name
- sendgrid_automatic_bcc

This will change in the future. It's just a crude proof of concept.

TODO: update readme with proper description and tutorial
